# Swader's Tampermonkey Repo

These are some Tampermonkey scripts I wrote for various websites. Some might be abandoned by the time you see this repo, but most should work fine. They're no rocket science, just 5-minute snippets I wanted for changing some layout or something on a site, nothing special, but feel free to use them.
